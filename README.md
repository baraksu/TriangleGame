The program takes height and width numbers from the user and draws an isosceles triangle.
After the triangle is drawn the user can move it using the arrow keys. The user can press multiple keys a once and the triangle will be moved by the order the keys were pressed using the buffer.

## Usage

1. execute the file using an assembly 8086 emulator.
2. insert the triagle size - height and width
3. wait until the triangle is drawn.
4. move the triangle by pressing the arrow keys.

## future features

I would add:
1. better ui
